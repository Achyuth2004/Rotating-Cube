## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the cube layout.
- **CSS**: Styling and applying 3D transformations for the cube animation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Implementation Details
The cube is created using `div` elements styled with CSS to represent each face. Different background colors are applied to simulate a multi-colored rotating cube effect. The animation is achieved using CSS `@keyframes` for a continuous and seamless rotation.

Feel free to explore and customize the cube by tweaking the colors, dimensions, or animation settings to suit your preferences!
